# Project Understanding
C++ code that implements a Netflix list film using linked list data structure. Using the linked list data structure, many methods were implemented, every method performs a certain task using a certain algorithm, such as: add a film, add a film at a certain position, display the film list, enter the index of film to find it, enter the index of film to delete it, delete the entire list, arrange the films alphabetically, check if the list is empty, save to file and load from file.

# Code Execution
After execution, the code itself gives the user guidelines on how to proceed and see the methods implemented in action.
